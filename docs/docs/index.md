## What problem does Kalavai address

Despite the hype of new models, **AI remains hard to leverage in real world scenarios**. We've been there, in startups, as AI developers. We have experienced how **expensive the hardware is** to procure; we've felt frustrated with **cloud providers rationing GPUs**; we've wasted countless hours in **devops rabbit-holes** configuring and managing multiple machines, distracted away from the actual fun of AI. All of this makes AI inaccessible for most.


## Who is Kalavai built for

* Research institutions such as Universities and research centres
* Enterprises looking to deploy AI in their workflows but without a big devops team
* The AI community looking to train and deploy Large Language Models -larger than any single device they own


## Getting started

* Create your very own [AI cluster](bootstrap.md) from your device.
* [Invite others](join.md) to join in.
* Use Kalavai to support your [AI work](install_apps.md)
* See an [end to end example](end2end.md) of how to setup a multi-node AI cluster
* Have a question? Check the answers to [commonly asked questions](faqs.md)
