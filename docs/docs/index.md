# Welcome to Kalavai

> Kalavai is an **open source** platform that turns **everyday devices** into your very own AI supercomputer. We help you aggregate resources from multiple machines: home desktops, gaming laptops, work computers, cloud VMs... When you need to **go beyond**, Kalavai **facilitates matchmaking** of resources so anyone in our community can tap into a larger pool of devices by **inspiring others to join** your cause.

## What does Kalavai do

Kalavai's goal is to make AI hardware accessible and affordable to all. We do it in two ways:

1. The open source version can be used to pool any devices, for _commercial and non-commercial_ purposes. This is perfect as **a management layer for research groups and organisations** that already have hardware lying around and wish to unlock its power, without requiring a devops team. These AI pools are free, secure and totally private.

2. Our [managed version](https://platform.kalavai.net) acts as a **social network for AI computing**, facilitating users to connect with the community's resources. _Think Reddit, but instead of memes, users share resources with inspiring projects._
