## What problem does Kalavai address

Despite the hype of new models, **AI remains hard to leverage in real world scenarios**. We've been there, in startups, as AI developers. We have experienced how **expensive the hardware is** to procure; we've felt frustrated with **cloud providers rationing GPUs**; we've wasted countless hours in **devops rabbit-holes** configuring and managing multiple machines, distracted away from the actual fun of AI. All of this makes AI inaccessible for most.


## Who is Kalavai built for

* Research institutions such as Universities and research centres
* Enterprises looking to deploy AI in their workflows but without a big devops team
* The AI community looking to train and deploy Large Language Models -larger than any single device they own
